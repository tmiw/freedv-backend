// TX AGC, replacing AgcStep (whose WebRtcAgc_Process, even with
// compressionGaindB=0, applies a fixed internal ~3:1 compression ratio with
// makeup gain rather than acting as a pure limiter).
//
// Two stages, run per 10ms chunk entirely in floating point, so leveler
// gain that pushes peaks above full scale reaches the limiter intact and
// samples are only converted back to int16 once, after limiting:
//
// 1. Leveler: slowly adjusts gain (within +/-12dB) so that the momentary
//    loudness measured at this step's *output* converges on a target LUFS.
//    Measuring after the limiter closes the loop, so the leveler responds
//    to what is actually sent to the encoder, and brief peaks caught by
//    the limiter don't pull its gain down. Gain is driven by a PI
//    controller and smoothed, so the correction scales with the size of
//    the error and settles on the target rather than moving at a fixed
//    dB/sec rate. Gain holds during pauses in speech.
//
// 2. Look-ahead peak limiter driving a single high-ratio soft knee just
//    below full scale, so it only engages on loud excursions near clipping
//    and leaves ordinary speech untouched. The audio is delayed by the
//    look-ahead window; the gain each sample needs is held at its minimum
//    across the window, then smoothed by a moving average of the same
//    length. The gain therefore ramps down smoothly ahead of each peak and
//    is fully in place when the peak reaches the output, so peaks never
//    overshoot the knee curve, however sudden their onset. Leaving speech
//    dynamics alone matters because the RADE encoder is expected to have
//    been trained on uncompressed speech. A lower "compressor" knee was
//    tried and removed: its frequent gain reduction fed the leveler's
//    feedback loop an upward bias on loud input.

    //   speech.

    //   its state is frozen, so re-enabling resumes from where it was. The
